    "#  Domain Background (Telecom Churn Story) \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a data analyst at a telecommunication comapany (let's call it TeleComCo). TelComCo provides phone  and internet services to customers. Like all telecom\n",
    "Companies, TeleComCo is concerned about customer churn- when customers stop using the service. High churn rated means lost revenue and can indicate dissatisfaction with\n",
    "the sevice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Story: Last quater, TeleComCo noticed an increase in customers leaving for competitors. The management has asked your team to investigate why customers are churning and\n",
    "to build a model that can predict which customers are at risk of leaving. With such a model, the company can proactively reach out to at-risk customers with retention offers.\n",
    "You have been provided with a dataset of past and current customers containing various details about their accounts and whether or not they churned. Your task is to analyze this data, find patterns related to churn, and create a predictive model using logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the data, you might uncover stories such as :- Long-term loyal customers(with many months of tenur might churn less) often, whereas new custmers are more at risk - customer with certain plans or higher monthly charges might be more inclined to leave, \n",
    "perhaps due to cost- Demographics might play a role-for example, senior citizens could have different usage patterns or needs. - Payment and service preferences (like using paperless billing or having phone service bundled) might correlate with churn behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through careful inestigation and modeling, TeleComCo hopes to reduce churn by understanding these patterns and intervening in time.\n",

    "# <u>Dataset Description</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of customer records, each with a variety of features describing the customer and their service usage. below is an overview of each column in the data:\n",
    "- `customer_id :` A unique identifier for each customer (e.g. a UUID). This is just an ID and not useful for prediction.\n",
    "- `customer_email :` THe email address of the customer. This is an identifier as well as not directly useful for the model.\n",
    "- `age :` The age of the customer(in years). This could be related to churn if different age groups ahve different service preferences.\n",
    "- `senior_citizen :` Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (boolean: true/False). Typically, this might be derived from age (e.g, age > 65).\n",
    "- `partner :` Whether the customer has a partner or not(boolean). This indicates if the customer is married or in a long-term partnership. In telecom, having a partner might mean family plans or shared services.\n",
    "- `dependents :` Whether the customer has dependents (children or other dependents) or not (boolean). Customers with dependents might have different usge(e.g, family plans.)\n",
    "- `tenure_months :` The number of months the customer has been with the company. Higher tenure might indicate loyality; low tenure customers are newer and might be more likely to curn if they haven't establidhed loyality.\n",
    "- `phone_sercive :` Whether the customer has phone service with the company(boolean). Some customers might only have internet service; this feature tells if they also subscribed to phone\n",
    "- `paperless_billing :` Whether the customer has opted for paperless billing (boolean). This could be a proxy for tech-savvy behaviour or convenience preference.\n",
    "- `monthly_charges :` The total amount `$` charged to the customer every month. This is like their monthly bill.\n",
    "Customers with higher bills might churn due to cost, or those with very low bills might churn if they are not using many services.\n",
    "- `total_charges :` The total amount `$` the customer has been charged since joining (this is roughly monthly_charges * tenure, plus any extras). This can indicate the overall value of the customer, low total charges might mean the customer is relatively new or has a low_cost plan.\n",
    "- `churn :` The target variable - whether the customer has churned (true = yes, the customer left; false = no, the customer is still with  the company). This is what we want to predict.\n",
    "- `last_interaction_date : ` The date of the last interaction with the customer (could be the last service use or last customer support call, etc.). This might give insight into how recently the customer was active. Customers with very old last interactions might have silently chrned.\n",
    "- `region :` The geographic region or state where the customer resides(e.g., Ohio , California, etc). Different regions might have different market conditions or competitor presence , possible affecting churn.\n",
    "- `signup_date :` Thedate when the customer originally signed up for service. (Note: This column is present in one of the source files. When we merged data, some records might not have a signup_date if it wasn't recorded for them)\n",

    "## Potential Questions and Considerations:\n",
    "<u>Based  on the above features, here are some questions that might arise and that will explore in this project</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do older customers or senior citizens tend to churn more or less tahan younger customer?\n",
    "- Does having a partnerr or dependents influence churn? (For example, do single customers churn more often than those with family plans?)\n",
    "- How does tenure relate to churn? Are newer customer more likely to leaves comapred to long-term customers?\n",
    "- What about monthly charges? Are customers with high monthly charges more likely to churn (perhapes due to higher cost),or could it be that those with low charges churn because they might not be fully utilizing the service?\n",
    "- Are there any regional trends in churn? (We might check if certain regions have higher churn rates.)\n",
    "- How do features like phone service or paperless billing correlate with churn? (e.g,maybe paperless billing user are more engaged or maybe less personal interactioon leads to higher churn?)\n",
    "- Are ther outliers or unusual values in charges or tenure that need special attention?\n",
